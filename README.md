## 📝 VEDIT: A Rust-Based Text Editor Inspired by THE and KEDIT

**VEDIT** is a terminal-first text editor written in Rust, inspired by [The Hessling Editor (THE)](https://hessling-editor.sourceforge.net/), Mansfiled Software Group's [Kedit](https://www.kedit.com), and a <u>little bit</u> of [vi](https://www.vim.org). It aims to bring modern performance, configurability, and scripting to a classic editing experience—optimized for <u>block/columnar operations</u>, syntax highlighting, and <del>REXX macro support</del> AI integration. 

---

### 🚀 Goals

- 🧱 Rebuild THE in Rust with a modular, maintainable architecture
- 🖥️ Focus on terminal-based (TUI) editing (no GUI/X11 dependency, no mouse)
- 🧩 Support block/columnar editing and customizable keybindings
- 🎨 Integrate syntax highlighting with user-defined themes
- 🧠 Enable AI integration to perform functionality previously provided by REXX macros
- 🛠️ Provide clear documentation and reproducible workflows

### 🧰 Architecture Overview

| Component            | Role                                      | Rust Crate / Tool |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Terminal UI         | Input, layout, rendering                  | `ratatui`, `crossterm` |
| Syntax Highlighting | Language-aware coloring                   | `syntect`         |
| Config System       | User preferences, themes, keymaps         | `serde`, `toml`   |
| File I/O            | Open/save, buffer management              | `std::fs`         |
| AI Integration      | Multiple model support                    | TBD               |
| Plugin System (opt) | Extensibility via dynamic loading         | `libloading` or `wasmer` |
