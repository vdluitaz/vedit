VEDIT HELP
==========

This is the help system for VEDIT, a terminal-based text editor inspired by THE and KEDIT.

CONFIGURATION
=============

VEDIT is configured via ~/.vedit.toml. The main settings are:

- theme: Syntax highlighting theme (e.g., "base16-pop")
- tab_width: Number of spaces for tab (default 4)
- syntax_map: File extension to syntax mapping (e.g., rs = "Rust", py = "Python")

Example ~/.vedit.toml:
theme = "base16-pop"
tab_width = 4
[syntax_map]
rs = "Rust"
py = "Python"
md = "Markdown"

COMMAND LINE
============

The command line is accessed by pressing the Home key. Type commands and press Enter.

Available commands:

- q/quit: Exit the editor. If changes are unsaved, prompts for confirmation.
- s/save: Save the current file.
- lnum: Toggle line number display in the left margin.
